# Basic Python Projects 

# Beginner Friendly Chat Bot 

This Python script creates a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot is designed to have conversations with users. The code reads an API key from a secure .env file, sets up communication with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model, and then starts a chat loop. Users can type messages, and the chatbot responds based on the input. The conversation continues until the user types "exit" to end the interaction. The script showcases the use of advanced natural language processing provided by GPT-3.5 Turbo, making the chatbot capable of engaging in meaningful and context-aware conversations.


# Speed Test Code 
Imagine a program that lets you test your internet speed with just a click
! This Python script builds a basic screen with a "Start Test" button. Once 
you click it, the program uses a tool called "speedtest" to measure how fast your
internet uploads and downloads data, and how long it takes to connect to websites. 
It then displays the results on the screen, showing you download speed (for things like streaming videos)
, upload speed (for sending emails or photos), and even the 
response time (how long it takes to talk to websites). It's like having a mini 
internet speedometer for your computer!
While this program works well, it can be improved by removing unnecessary 
windows and organizing the code more neatly. But overall, it's a cool example of using Python to create a simple and helpful tool!

# Typing speed and accuracy test 
This Python script conducts a typing speed and accuracy test. It randomly selects a sentence from a predefined list, prompts the user to type it, measures the time taken, and calculates typing speed and accuracy. The program showcases random sentence generation, input handling, and basic performance metrics. Users receive feedback on their typing speed, accuracy, and overall performance after completing the test.


# Language Translation Using Tkinter 

This Python script implements a simple language translation application using Tkinter and the `translate` library. The application provides a user-friendly interface for translating text from one language to another.

## Features
- **Language Selection:** Users can choose both the input language and the target language from a list of available options, including Hindi, English, French, German, and Spanish.
- **Text Input and Output:** Enter the text to be translated in the "Enter Text" field, and the translated output will be displayed in the "Output Text" field. Tkinter StringVar variables are used to dynamically link input and output fields.
- **Translation Functionality:** The translation is performed using the `translate` function from the `translate` library. The translation function is triggered when the user clicks the "Translate" button.
- **Graphical User Interface:** The Tkinter library is utilized to create a basic graphical user interface with labels, entry fields, drop-down menus, and a translation button.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter
- `translate`

## Further Customization

Feel free to customize the code or expand the application by adding more features, error handling, or enhancing the user interface.

## Conclusion

This language translation application serves as a practical example for beginners interested in building graphical applications for language processing tasks. Explore the code, experiment with different languages, and adapt it to your specific needs.
