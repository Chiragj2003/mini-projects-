# Basic Python Projects 

## Beginner Friendly Chat Bot 

This Python script creates a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot is designed to have conversations with users. The code reads an API key from a secure .env file, sets up communication with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model, and then starts a chat loop. Users can type messages, and the chatbot responds based on the input. The conversation continues until the user types "exit" to end the interaction. The script showcases the use of advanced natural language processing provided by GPT-3.5 Turbo, making the chatbot capable of engaging in meaningful and context-aware conversations.


## Speed Test Code 
Imagine a program that lets you test your internet speed with just a click
! This Python script builds a basic screen with a "Start Test" button. Once 
you click it, the program uses a tool called "speedtest" to measure how fast your
internet uploads and downloads data, and how long it takes to connect to websites. 
It then displays the results on the screen, showing you download speed (for things like streaming videos)
, upload speed (for sending emails or photos), and even the 
response time (how long it takes to talk to websites). It's like having a mini 
internet speedometer for your computer!
While this program works well, it can be improved by removing unnecessary 
windows and organizing the code more neatly. But overall, it's a cool example of using Python to create a simple and helpful tool!
